## Key Features:
•	ETL Transition to PostgreSQL: Successfully modified existing SSIS packages to connect with PostgreSQL via ODBC, ensuring seamless data flow.
•	Data Warehousing: Created a data warehouse to store and manage data, with fact tables for transactions and dimension tables for customers, products, time, and branches.
•	Data Cleaning: Resolved null values in the product dataset using Python, ensuring accurate analysis of product categories.
•	Data Analysis and Visualization: Grouped products by category and performed statistical counts; created bar plots and visualizations showing product distribution and branch performance.
•	Automation and Reporting: Designed workflows to automate the extraction, transformation, and reporting processes, providing daily updated reports.
